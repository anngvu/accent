## ACCENT

Data curation has been likened to the work of an art or museum curation[^1]. 
Those communities that are supported by dedicated and professional data managers receive the benefit of having data packaged and displayed to the best advantage. 
Data managers themselves could benefit from tooling to facilitate their work. 

The Assisted Curation/Content ENhancement Tool is, in its first iteration, is a CLI tool that first focuses on dataset curation for NF-OSI. 
Data can be more accentuated as datasets, since datasets are often more easily displayed and are a more approachable conceptual unit when there is a lot of data (compared to attempting to do the same with individual files).
