        ## Instructions for trying out table query and viz with Syndi
        1. Choose a table that you know well and that another Sage employee can access, since it will be easier to reproduce and understand.
        2. Add documentation to the root Wiki page for the table.
           Try to at least describe the columns and provide 1-2 example queries. 
           This is inserted as context so *you* are the one doing "prompt engineering"; feel free to experiment with contextual content to improve the results. 
        3. Create benchmark questions. Try for between 4-20 questions with a variety ranging from "easy" to "hard". 
        ## How your report will be used
        We'll use this to understand what type of Synapse table data are of interest/fair game (aside from the obvious portal-related tables); how each type of table data works with the current defaults; 
        how users try to optimize documentation for AI reusability; the range of natural conversations for query/viz tasks and what derailment/miscommunication may look like.
